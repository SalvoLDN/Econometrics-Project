EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This paper explores the argument of reducing the gender wage gap to boost economic growth. 
The hypothesis is that reducing the gender wage gap would lead to increase the rate of GDP 
growth. Standard econometrics techniques are employed to determine the effects of a reduction 
in gender wage gap on GDP and obtain quantitative data to quantify the effects of the reduction 
in wage gap through an increase in average hourly wage rate of female workers. First, standard 
OLS estimates are obtained through the classic linear multiple regression model. After conducting 
test for autocorrelation, unit root test, and cointegration, a regression model in first differences 
and an autoregressive distributed lag model are produced to test the hypothesis. Each model
confirms the hypothesis that reducing the gender wage gap would lead to an increase in GDP.
